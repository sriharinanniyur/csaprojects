The tour offered at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. was an awkward and trying experience. Doof himself is an entertaining and fun guy, but also clumsy and strange. He kept forgetting which inators he showed us because he was constantly reminiscing about his pathetic yet hilarious childhood. Overall, a mediocre but interesting experience.
