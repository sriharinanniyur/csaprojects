 Being a 72 year old woman who has long hair, short hair and every style in between, I've had all kinds of brushes and your brush is with out exception the best ever. As I've aged my hair has gotten thinner and I've been concerned with what products to use and my brush was important. When I went on line looking for "best hair brush for thinning, fine hair" Amazon suggested yours. I'm just amaze by how much I love it! I swear my hair seems thicker!!! Congratulations on a wonderful produce. My only concern is how to clean it when it needs it since it has such a beautiful wooden handle. Thanks you!
