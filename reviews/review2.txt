I returned the brush. If I could give this 0 stars I would. I ran the brush through my hair once and noticed immediately something felt sharp and scratching across my scalp. I look at the brush and the ends of some of the pins didn't have the rounded balls, instead, they were pointy. Two of the other pins were melted together, again sharp and pointy. Also, 2 of the pins were missing entirely from the pad.

I have frequently lately that reviews and products don't match up. Something will be highly rated and then when you look at the reviews customer images or descriptions don't match up with the product. It's almost as if sellers are offering one product, getting high ratings on it and then replacing that listing with a different product that is low quality. This way it looks established and like it has high reviews. Most of the products I have encountered that with are clearly Chinese companies offering cheap products. Amazon has been slightly disappointing lately. I am sure this review will probably get filtered out as it is.
