The tour offered at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. was an amazing and wonderful experience. Doof himself is an entertaining and fun guy, but also surprising and *strange. He kept forgetting which inators he showed us because he was constantly reminiscing about his stellar yet hilarious childhood. Overall, a mediocre but interesting experience.
