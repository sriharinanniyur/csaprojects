Inator Inn is the worst hotel I have ever had the displeasure to visit. With how badly the rooms are set up, it seems the management just doesn't care. They have an utter lack of ammenties - no swimming pool, a vile view from the balcony, and I needed to pay for all the toiletries!

On top of that, the owner is incredibly rude and unwelcoming! I will never return.
