I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic food at Chez Perry's. All the food was homemade and super delicious, and it made the visit very memorable. Chez Perry's specializes in handmade chicken dishes that are all made from scratch.

Sleek and contemporary interior, good ambiance, great service and phenomenal tasting room!

The dining room is spacious and comfortable and everything on the table is made from scratch.
